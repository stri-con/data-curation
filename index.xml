      <description>Here is the link to the Practicals Page for Lesson 2. I will add new assignments every day or so to help you create a single page document. For now you can find the raw .Rmd file on GitHub. The link is in the title of the page.  R Markdown is a versatile framework for creating a range of high-quality documents including HTML, PDF, presentations, books, websites, and more.</description>

      <description>To make a successful coding project or website you need to know where and how to get help. In future posts, I will cover approaches specific to certain tools. In this post, I want to share some general tips and tricks about getting and asking for help. I touch on the idea of best practices to use so that your question is answered in the most efficient and effective way possible.</description>

      <title>Lesson 1: Building Your Working üß±Ô∏è Environment</title>
      <link>/data-curation/2020/04/01/lesson-1/</link>

      <description>We have a wide range of experience levels in this course, so the first lesson is devoted to setting up your working environment and laying down a good foundation for your projects. I would like to give everyone a chance to get everything installed and to get comfortable with these new tools before we dive in. I realize that some of you may have a lot of this done already.</description>

 As advertised, this course is about using R Markdown and GitHub. I appreciate that some of you may not want to spend time learning new skills that you don&amp;rsquo;t think you need. Originally I considered everything on this page to be optional, however I changed my mind. As I thought more about the structure of the course, I concluded that I would be doing you all a disservice if I made tools like HTML and CSS optional.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Open Science</title>

      <description>I wanted to share a few thoughts on what I see as key benefits to the community in creating data driven, open source, web products that capture and communicate your science. Bear with me for a minute. Well technically 4 minutes.
Accessibility &amp;amp; Inclusivity Many journals and journal articles sit behind pay walls that a lot of people can‚Äôt access. That sucks, and while people are revolting against this paradigm, for now this is the reality.</description>

Welcome Welcome to the LockDown 2020 Continuing Education course on Data Curation. This site (written mainly in R Markdown) will be our guidebook as we make our way through the topics. Our main goals with the course are to a) create interactive, data-driven web products in R Markdown, b) host those products on GitHub, and c) use tools like figshare for hosting data and data products.</description>

      <title>Lesson 0: An Example R Markdown Document</title>
      <link>/data-curation/2020/03/28/lesson-0/</link>

      <description>In this mini lesson I‚Äôd like to demonstrate a) some Markdown syntax, b) how you run and format R code, and c) how to render R figures. If you read the Course Description you have already seen examples of embedded tables. Remember, our primary goal is to create R Markdown documents that capture code, data, and data products.
 R Markdown integrates the concepts of literate programming and reproducible research, which, in addition to explaining or documenting itself, also allows others (including an original investigator) to reproduce a data analysis or other research result.</description>
