      <description>We have a wide range of experience levels in this course, so the first lesson is devoted to setting up your working environment and laying down a good foundation for your projects. I would like to give everyone a chance to get everything installed and to get comfortable with these new tools before we dive in. I realize that some of you may have a lot of this done already.</description>

      <description>As advertised, this course is about using R Markdown and GitHub. I appreciate that some of you may not want to spend time learning new skills that you probably won&amp;rsquo;t use. I decided to make this Tutorials page with optional material for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge beyond the immediate goals of the course.

      <description>I wanted to share a few thoughts on what I see as key benefits to the community in creating data driven, open source, web products that capture and communicate your science. Bear with me for a minute. Well technically 4 minutes.
Accessibility &amp;amp; Inclusivity Many journals and journal articles sit behind pay walls that a lot of people can‚Äôt access. That sucks, and while people are revolting against this paradigm, for now this is the reality.</description>

Welcome Welcome to the LockDown 2020 Continuing Education course on Data Curation. This site (written mainly in R Markdown) will be our guidebook as we make our way through the topics. Our main goals with the course are to a) create interactive, data-driven web products in R Markdown, b) host those products on GitHub, and c) use tools like figshare for hosting data and data products.</description>

      <title>Lesson 0: An Example R Markdown Document</title>
      <link>/data-curation/2020/03/28/lesson-0/</link>

      <description>In this mini lesson I‚Äôd like to demonstrate a) some Markdown syntax, b) how you run and format R code, and c) how to render R figures. If you read the Course Description you have already seen examples of embedded tables. Remember, our primary goal is to create R Markdown documents that capture code, data, and data products.
 R Markdown integrates the concepts of literate programming and reproducible research, which, in addition to explaining or documenting itself, also allows others (including an original investigator) to reproduce a data analysis or other research result.</description>

      <description>Coming Soon We (you and I) will add tools to this page as we go along. Until then, here&amp;rsquo;s a puppy.
