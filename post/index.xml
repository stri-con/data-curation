      <title>Practical Exercises</title>

      <description>This page provides quick links to the Practical Exercises‚Äîthe hands-on learning portion of the course. These exercises are written entirely in R Markdown, as opposed to the course website, which contains Hugo, CSS, and HTML code. Because I want you to work in pure R Markdown, I created separate pages for the exercises. The look and feel of these pages are different than the main course website. What this means is that you should be able to implement anything you see on the Practical Pages in your own documents using only R Markdown.</description>

      <description>Here is the link to the Practicals Page for Lesson 2. I will add new assignments every day or so to help you create a single page document. For now you can find the raw .Rmd file on GitHub. The link is in the title of the Practicals Page.  R Markdown is a versatile framework for creating a range of high-quality documents including HTML, PDF, presentations, books, websites, and more.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility</title>

      <description>In this post I want to share some best practices for creating reproducible documents and workflows.  Reproducibility I already made a case for why reproducible research is important. So now lets define the term and see if we can‚Äôt come up with a set of criteria that encompasses its meaning. Reproducibility ‚Ä¶
      ‚Ä¶ [is a] set of procedures that permit the reader of a paper to see the entire processing trail from the raw data and code to figures and tables 1.</description>

      <description>To make a successful coding project or website you need to know where and how to get help. In future posts, I will cover approaches specific to certain tools. In this post, I want to share some general tips and tricks about getting and asking for help. I touch on the idea of best practices to use so that your question is answered in the most efficient and effective way possible.</description>

      <title>Lesson 1: Building Your Working üß±Ô∏è Environment</title>
      <link>/data-curation/2020/04/01/lesson-1/</link>

      <description>We have a wide range of experience levels in this course, so the first lesson is devoted to setting up your working environment and laying down a good foundation for your projects. I would like to give everyone a chance to get everything installed and to get comfortable with these new tools before we dive in. I realize that some of you may have a lot of this done already.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Open Science</title>

      <description>I wanted to share a few thoughts on what I see as key benefits to the community in creating data driven, open source, web products that capture and communicate your science. Bear with me for a minute. Well technically 4 minutes.
Accessibility &amp;amp; Inclusivity Many journals and journal articles sit behind pay walls that a lot of people can‚Äôt access. That sucks, and while people are revolting against this paradigm, for now this is the reality.</description>

      <title>Lesson 0: An Example R Markdown Document</title>
      <link>/data-curation/2020/03/28/lesson-0/</link>

      <description>In this mini lesson I‚Äôd like to demonstrate a) some Markdown syntax, b) how you run and format R code, and c) how to render R figures. If you read the Course Description you have already seen examples of embedded tables. Remember, our primary goal is to create R Markdown documents that capture code, data, and data products.
 R Markdown integrates the concepts of literate programming and reproducible research, which, in addition to explaining or documenting itself, also allows others (including an original investigator) to reproduce a data analysis or other research result.</description>
