This page provides quick links to the Practical Exercisesâ€”the hands-on learning portion of the course. These exercises are written entirely in R Markdown, as opposed to the course website, which contains Hugo, CSS, and HTML code. Because I want you to work in pure R Markdown, I created separate pages for the exercises. The look and feel of these pages are different than the main course website. What this means is that you should be able to implement anything you see on the Practical Pages in your own documents using only R Markdown. The raw code for each lesson is available on the linked GitHub repo.
