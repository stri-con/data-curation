R Markdown is a versitle framework for creating a range of [high-quality documents](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html) including HTML, PDF, presentations, books, websites, and more. Markdown allows documents to be simple and portable. R gives you the benefit of creating dynamic documents that contain your results (e.g., tables, graphics, and inline values). Results can be computed and rendered dynamically from R code and as such are more likely to be reproducible.

> In this lesson you will (1) learn about the key parts of an R Markdown document; (2) create a simple, single page R Markdown document; (3) use basic methods to tweak the behavior and look of the document.

At the end of the lesson, I provide a minimal example template for you to reference while you make your own page.

## Basic Structure

A basic, single page, R Markdown document is created with just three element: the YAML header, Markdown-formatted text, and R code. Technically, you do not need the R code; many of the pages on this site have no R code at all. But for our purposes we will incorporate R code as a *neccessary ingredient* so that you can experience the potential of R Markdown. Even if you don't know much R, I want you to incorporate some R code in your document. I am happy to provide you with the tools you need. Many of your classmates are expert R coders so please ask for help on the `#course-curation` Slack channel. Further customization can be achived with additional CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and/or HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) code, both of which will be the subject of a future lesson. For this lesson we focus on the three core elements.

### The YAML header

At the top of the document you must included the YAML metadata. YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)

For a single page document like the one you will create in this lesson, the YAML metadata need to be enclosed in delimiters, specifically three dashes (---). The delimeters must be on their own lines.

```

Between the delimeters you write the metadata.
