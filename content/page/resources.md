This page contains quick access to valuable resources. I have  categorized them based on language, tool etc.


## YAML

* [The YAML Fieldguide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ymlthis/vignettes/yaml-fieldguide.html). List of YAML arguements & explaination for all types of documents.



## Markdown

* [Markdown Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables). Tired of typing all of those hyphens and pipes?
* [Basic Markdown Syntax Reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
* [Extended Markdown Syntax Reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/).


## Command Line Interface

* [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/). By Idan Kamara. Write a command to see the help text that matches each argument. Awesome.
*

## CSS & HTML

* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/). Everything you ever wanted to know about CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Tons of tutorials, examples, and explainations. I spend a lot of time here.

Even though this page has some resources, I think the puppy can stay.
