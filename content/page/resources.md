## R Markdown

>  [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). Title says it all. You should use this. A lot.
* [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/). Another *must have*.
* [RStudio IDE Cheatsheet](/data-curation/page/files/rstudio-ide.pdf). An overview of the RStudio IDE.

* [Another R Markdown Cheatsheet](/data-curation/page/files/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf). One more? There are a lot of cheatsheets.
* [R Markdown Reference Guide](/data-curation/page/files/rmarkdown-reference.pdf). Good section on *Chunk Options*.

## YAML

* [The YAML Fieldguide](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ymlthis/vignettes/yaml-fieldguide.html). List of YAML arguments & explanations.
* [Data Format Converter](https://toolkit.site/format.html). Switch between YAML and TOML. Must omit the delimiters.
* [R Markdown Theme Gallery](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/). Change theme in YAML header to get a different look. Valid themes for HTML documents include: *default, cerulean, journal, flatly, readable, spacelab, united, cosmo, lumen, paper, sandstone, simplex, and yeti*.

## Markdown

There are many similarities with the R Markdown references above.

* [Basic Markdown Syntax Reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) from *[The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)*, a free and open-source reference guide.
* [Extended Markdown Syntax Reference](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/) also from *[The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)*.
* [Markdown Tables Generator](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables). Tired of typing all of those hyphens and pipes?

## Command Line Interface

* [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/). By Idan Kamara. Write a command to see the help text that matches each argument. Awesome.

## CSS & HTML

Both w3schools and MDN web docs have extensive information about CSS and HTML. These are amazing resources.

* [w3schools HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp). HTML tutorials, examples, and explanations.

* [Basic tutorial & quick reference](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) from StackExchange. A bit old now but still good.
* [LaTeX mathematics cheat sheet](https://davidhamann.de/2017/06/12/latex-cheat-sheet/) from David Hamann.

Even though this page has some resources, I think the puppy can stay.
