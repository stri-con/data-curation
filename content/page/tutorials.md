As advertised, this course is about using R Markdown and GitHub. I appreciate that some of you may not want to spend time learning new skills that you probably won't use. I decided to make this *Tutorials* page with optional material for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge beyond the immediate goals of the course.

## HTML & CSS

Websites are built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For any site, HTML defines the content and structure; CSS provides the style and layout; JavaScript programs the behavior.

If you want to develop your HTML/CSS skills, you can start by working through these tutorials. At this point in the course, learning HTML/CSS is *optional* but if there is enough demand for more, I can incorporate these languages more formerly. If you have no interest in learning these languages that is totally fine. You do not need them to use R Markdown. I do believe however that a little knowledge of HTML and CSS goes a long way. As I mentioned, if you go far enough with R Markdown, you will encounter its limitations. I encourage you check out some of these tutorials (right now there is only 1 :)

### Interneting is Hard

I have explored a lot of tutorials for HTML/CSS and this is my favorite. There are 14 lessons that cover  many important skills. The tutorials are simple and straightforward. It is also a good opportunity to start working in your fancy new source code editor and testing out the dev tool functions of your browser.

### But is doesn't have to be
