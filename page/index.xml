Welcome Welcome to the LockDown 2020 Continuing Education course on Data Curation at STRI-Panama. This site (written mainly in R Markdown) will be our guidebook as we make our way through the topics. Our main goals with the course are to a) create interactive, data-driven web products in R Markdown, b) host those products on GitHub, and c) use tools like figshare for hosting data and data products.</description>
