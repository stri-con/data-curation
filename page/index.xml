      <description>As advertised, this course is about using R Markdown and GitHub. I appreciate that some of you may not want to spend time learning new skills that you don&amp;rsquo;t think you need. I decided to make this Tutorials page with optional material for anyone who wants to expand their knowledge beyond the immediate goals of the course. Originally I considered everything on this page to be optional, however I changed my mind.</description>

Welcome Welcome to the LockDown 2020 Continuing Education course on Data Curation. This site (written mainly in R Markdown) will be our guidebook as we make our way through the topics. Our main goals with the course are to a) create interactive, data-driven web products in R Markdown, b) host those products on GitHub, and c) use tools like figshare for hosting data and data products.</description>
