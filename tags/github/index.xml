      <description>To make a successful coding project or website you need to know where and how to get help. In future posts, I will cover approaches specific to certain tools. In this post, I want to share some general tips and tricks about getting and asking for help. I touch on the idea of best practices to use so that your question is answered in the most efficient and effective way possible.</description>

      <description>We have a wide range of experience levels in this course, so the first lesson is devoted to setting up your working environment and laying down a good foundation for your projects. I would like to give everyone a chance to get everything installed and to get comfortable with these new tools before we dive in. I realize that some of you may have a lot of this done already.</description>
