 As advertised, this course is about using R Markdown and GitHub. I appreciate that some of you may not want to spend time learning new skills that you don&amp;rsquo;t think you need. Originally I considered everything on this page to be optional, however I changed my mind. As I thought more about the structure of the course, I concluded that I would be doing you all a disservice if I made tools like HTML and CSS optional.</description>
