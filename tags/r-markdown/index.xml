      <description>This page provides quick links to the Practical Exercisesâ€”the hands-on learning portion of the course. These exercises are written entirely in R Markdown, as opposed to the course website, which contains Hugo, CSS, and HTML code. Because I want you to work in pure R Markdown, I created separate pages for the exercises. The look and feel of these pages are different than the main course website. What this means is that you should be able to implement anything you see on the Practical Pages in your own documents using only R Markdown.</description>

      <description>Here is the link to the Practicals Page for Lesson 2. I will add new assignments every day or so to help you create a single page document. For now you can find the raw .Rmd file on GitHub. The link is in the title of the Practicals Page.  R Markdown is a versatile framework for creating a range of high-quality documents including HTML, PDF, presentations, books, websites, and more.</description>

      <title>Lesson 0: An Example R Markdown Document</title>
      <link>/data-curation/2020/03/28/lesson-0/</link>

      <description>In this mini lesson Iâ€™d like to demonstrate a) some Markdown syntax, b) how you run and format R code, and c) how to render R figures. If you read the Course Description you have already seen examples of embedded tables. Remember, our primary goal is to create R Markdown documents that capture code, data, and data products.
 R Markdown integrates the concepts of literate programming and reproducible research, which, in addition to explaining or documenting itself, also allows others (including an original investigator) to reproduce a data analysis or other research result.</description>
